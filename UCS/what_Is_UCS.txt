What is Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)?
  Uniform-Cost Search is a way for a computer to find the cheapest path to a goal.

Why UCS = Dijkstra?

Because:
    Both use a priority queue
    Both expand the lowest-cost node
    Both guarantee the shortest path
What is the time complexity of Uniform-Cost Search given branching factor 


Answer:

Uniform-Cost Search expands nodes in increasing order of path cost.
In the worst case, UCS expands all nodes whose path cost is less than or equal to the optimal solution cost 

If all edge costs = 1
→ UCS behaves exactly like BFS.

If edge costs are different
→ UCS behaves like Dijkstra’s Algorithm.

In fact:

UCS = Dijkstra (without goal stopping condition difference)
