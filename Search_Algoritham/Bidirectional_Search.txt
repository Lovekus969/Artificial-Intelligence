Bidirectional Search
What it is

Bidirectional Search runs two searches at the same time:

    One forward from the start node
    
    One backward from the goal node
    
    The search stops when both searches meet in the middle.
Time Complexity

Let:

  b = branching factor
  d = depth of the optimal solution
        Bidirectional Search  Time Complexity:  
            O(b^ d/2)
Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)

Time Complexity:

O(b^ 1+ ⌊C*/ε])
