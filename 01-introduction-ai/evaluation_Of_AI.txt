The Evolution of AI
  AI has evolved through several major phases:

️1. Symbolic AI (Good Old-Fashioned AI)
        Focused on rules, logic, and symbolic reasoning
        Used in expert systems
        Strength: Explainable reasoning
        Limitation: Poor performance in complex, real-world environments
        
️2.  Statistical & Data-Driven AI
        Uses probability, statistics, and machine learning
        Learns patterns from data instead of hard-coded rules

️3. Modern AI & Deep Learning
        Neural networks with many layers
        Used in speech recognition, image recognition, and autonomous systems
        Enabled by GPUs, big data, and cloud computing
        
Nowadays, Current State of the Art in AI
        Today, AI systems are widely used across many domains:
        Computer Vision – facial recognition, medical imaging
        Natural Language Processing – chatbots, translation, voice assistants
        Game Playing – AlphaGo, chess engines
        Autonomous Systems – self-driving cars, drones
        Recommendation Systems – Netflix, YouTube, Amazon
        Healthcare – disease diagnosis, drug discovery
        
  Modern AI systems are powerful but are usually narrow AI, meaning they are designed for specific tasks rather than general intelligence.
