What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
  Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that focuses on creating machines and systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include reasoning, learning, problem-solving, perception, language understanding, and decision-making.
  AI aims to build intelligent agents—systems that can perceive their environment through sensors and act upon that environment through actuators to achieve specific goals.
     
      “We call ourselves Homo sapiens—man the wise—because our intelligence is so important to us.”
      This highlights why replicating or simulating intelligence has always been a central goal of AI research.
      
Historical Foundations of AI
  The idea of artificial intelligence dates back to ancient times, where myths and stories described artificial beings with human-like intelligence. However, AI as a scientific discipline began in the mid-20th century.

Key Milestones:

    1943 – McCulloch & Pitts proposed the first mathematical model of artificial neurons.
    1950 – Alan Turing introduced the Turing Test to evaluate machine intelligence.
    1956 – The term Artificial Intelligence was officially coined at the Dartmouth Conference by John McCarthy.
    1960s–1970s – Early AI programs focused on problem solving and symbolic reasoning.
    1980s – Rise of expert systems used in industry.
    1990s–2000s – AI experienced periods of reduced funding known as AI winters.
    2010s–Present – Explosion of AI due to big data, faster hardware, and deep learning.
