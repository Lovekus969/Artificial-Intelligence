Solving Problems by Searching
What does “Solving Problems by Searching” actually mean?
    In AI, we don’t jump to solutions.
    We search through possibilities systematically.
              AI = Agent + Environment + Goal + Search
Problem-Solving Agents
    A problem-solving agent:
          perceives the environment
          decides what to do
          plans before acting
    
    How it works:      Goal formulation – What do I want?
          Problem formulation – How can I reach it?
          Search – Which sequence of actions works?
          Execution – Perform the actions

Problem-solving through search in AI is analogous to state transition systems in automata theory, where an agent explores transitions from an initial state to a goal state, similar to reaching an accepting state in finite automata, but with cost and heuristic guidance
